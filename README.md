### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Matthias and I currently working as Software Engineer at [qupaya](https://qupaya.com/) and purchasing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.

I have somehow already worked in many different areas, including:

- Chatbot development (Node.js, GCP, Dialogflow, Rasa)
- FPGA development (Vivado, VHDL, C++, C, SystemC)
- Media informatics (C++, JPEG encoding, computer graphics, OpenGL, WebGL)
- Data Science (Python and its common libs)
- Development of a Software Generator for REST API (I love REST)
- Web development (Node.js, express, fastify, Nest.js, TypeScript)


But at the moment I particularly enjoy developing tooling for the standard-compliant implementation of web APIs. Because I am convinced that APIs can benefit enormously if they comply with HTTP specifications. I think model-driven approaches can also contribute to this.
