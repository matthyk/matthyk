### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Matthias and I am currently working as Software Engineer at [qupaya](https://qupaya.com/) and purchasing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. At the moment I particularly enjoy developing tooling for the standard-compliant implementation of web APIs. Because I am convinced that APIs can benefit enormously if they comply with HTTP specifications. I think model-driven approaches can also contribute to this.
Some topics I am currently interested in:

* Node.js
* REST
* HTTP
* Web Standards
* TypeScript
* Fastify
* Model-driven software development approaches
* OpenAPI
* JSONSchema

If you are interested in some projects I have already committed to: 

* [fastify-override](https://github.com/matthyk/fastify-override)
* [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)
* [find-my-way](https://github.com/delvedor/find-my-way)
