### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Matthias and I am currently working as Software Engineer at [qupaya](https://qupaya.com/) and purchasing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.

At the moment I particularly enjoy developing tooling for the standard-compliant implementation of web APIs. Because I am convinced that APIs can benefit enormously if they comply with HTTP specifications. I think model-driven approaches can also contribute to this.

I would say that I have at least _some_ knowledge in the following topics:
* Node.js
* REST
* HTTP
* Web Standards
* GCP
* TypeScript
* Fastify
* Nest.js
* Model-driven software development approaches

Have a look at my current projects and projects I contribute to:

* [fastify-override](https://github.com/matthyk/fastify-override)
* [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)
* [find-my-way](https://github.com/delvedor/find-my-way)
* [fastify-overview](https://github.com/Eomm/fastify-overview)
